## HTTP
**Protocol:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol  
**Port Number:** 80  
**Description:**  
HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is used to transfer hypertext (e.g., HTML) between clients (browsers) and servers.  

**Relevance to DevOps:**  
- Used for deploying web applications and APIs.  
- Monitoring HTTP traffic is crucial for ensuring application availability and performance.  
- Often integrated with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

---

## HTTPS
**Protocol:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure  
**Port Number:** 443  
**Description:**  
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption (TLS/SSL) to protect data in transit. It ensures data integrity and confidentiality.  

**Relevance to DevOps:**  
- Essential for securing web applications and APIs.  
- DevOps teams manage SSL/TLS certificates and ensure secure communication.  
- Automated tools like Let's Encrypt are often used for certificate management.

---

## FTP
**Protocol:** File Transfer Protocol  
**Port Number:** 21  
**Description:**  
FTP is used to transfer files between a client and a server over a network. It is commonly used for uploading files to web servers.  

**Relevance to DevOps:**  
- Used for transferring build artifacts, configuration files, and logs.  
- Often replaced by more secure alternatives like SFTP or SCP in modern workflows.  
- Still relevant in legacy systems and specific use cases.

---

## SSH
**Protocol:** Secure Shell  
**Port Number:** 22  
**Description:**  
SSH is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure remote login and command execution on servers.  

**Relevance to DevOps:**  
- Critical for managing servers and infrastructure remotely.  
- Used in automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines for deployment and configuration.  
- SSH keys are managed securely to ensure access control.

---

## DNS
**Protocol:** Domain Name System  
**Port Number:** 53  
**Description:**  
DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses that machines can understand.  

**Relevance to DevOps:**  
- DevOps teams configure and manage DNS records for application deployment.  
- Essential for load balancing, failover, and routing traffic to the correct servers.  
- Tools like Terraform and Ansible automate DNS management.

## Relevance to DevOps
Understanding these protocols is crucial for DevOps professionals because:  
- **Automation:** DevOps relies heavily on automating tasks like deployment, monitoring, and configuration, which often involve these protocols.  
- **Security:** Ensuring secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) is a key responsibility in DevOps.  
- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting:** Knowledge of these protocols helps in diagnosing network issues and optimizing performance.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Tools like Terraform and Ansible use these protocols to manage infrastructure.
